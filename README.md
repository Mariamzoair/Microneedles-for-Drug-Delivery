# Microneedles for Drug Delivery  
**Achieving Consistent and Controlled Drug Release in Coated Microneedles**

## Project Overview

This project investigates the challenges and optimizations in designing **drug-coated microneedles** for consistent, controlled transdermal drug delivery. With a focus on **insulin delivery**, it addresses key barriers in clinical translation, including uneven drug distribution, erratic release kinetics, and manufacturing scalability.

Microneedles offer a minimally invasive alternative to conventional injections. However, their effectiveness is often limited by variability in coating thickness and drug release behavior. This study proposes a systematic, experimental framework to identify optimal coating methods and polymer-drug formulations for enhanced performance.

## Research Goals

1. **Compare Four Coating Methods**  
   Dip coating, inkjet coating, immersion, and drop coating were evaluated based on:
   - Coating uniformity
   - Drug loading efficiency
   - Release profile over 48 hours

2. **Optimize Drug-to-Polymer Ratio**  
   Explored six different insulin-to-PLGA ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 3:1) to:
   - Maximize loading efficiency
   - Minimize burst release
   - Sustain drug release for 24–48 hours

3. **Validate Performance In-Vitro and In-Vivo**  
   - In-vitro: Strat-M membranes with Franz diffusion cells to assess release kinetics  
   - In-vivo: Sprague-Dawley rat model to compare glucose regulation vs. subcutaneous injection

## Innovation & Significance

- Demonstrated that **dip coating** provides superior uniformity (±10% thickness variation), drug loading (>85%), and sustained release kinetics.
- Optimized insulin-to-PLGA ratios (1:2 or 1:3) achieved:
  - ≤30% burst release in the first hour
  - Consistent release of 1–2% per hour up to 48 hours
- Achieved improved batch-to-batch reproducibility (<10% variation)
- Validated **biocompatibility** and **glucose regulation efficacy** equivalent or superior to subcutaneous injections
